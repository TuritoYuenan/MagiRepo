# Flag of Magical girl Homura
![](flagHomura.svg)
## Design
- **#102 Black background**: Her theme color, representing her identity
- **Red saltire**: A symbolism of Madoka's red ribbon, representing her goal and desire for Madoka
- **White star of David**: Jewish analogy to Homura's will, intelligence and suffering
Either that or I am just making up those since the flag was originally made for aesthetic.
